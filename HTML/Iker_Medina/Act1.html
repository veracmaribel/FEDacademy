                    <h2>Facts</h2>
                        <p>1. The first edition of the festival took place in 2005 and attracted a crowd of about 10,000 people. Due to the fact that it was the debut edition and to create 
                            more buzz, festival organizers were giving away free passes to Belgians to fill up the festival.</p>
                        <p>2. Although Tomorrowland started as a 1-day festival, it now takes place over 2 weekends and even then, tickets get sold out within minutes.</p>

                        <h2>Experiences</h2>
                        <p>It was a long queue to the festival area with a lot of security and drug dogs, 
                            but we made it! I can not even describe the experience when we first walked into Tomorrowland. It was everything we expected, but 10 times more. I don’t even try to explain it, because you truly can’t comprehend the epicness of the festival area unless you’ve experienced it yourself. All the details and decorations, you could easily spend hours 
                            just looking at the details of the stages, everything was so well put together! Truly magical!<small><a href="#">more...</a></small></p>
