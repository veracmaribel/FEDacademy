Audios need transcription.

Images should only be placed as background not css. A text should be hidden behind the bg image with the description.

No audios in websites, and if needed, a quick way to silence should be implemented.

Forms should not only be colors for validation, also images with a check.

Alt attribute should always be used.

All errors should be on text in forms.

Abbreviations need attribute to show all.

Set language in webpage.

Elements should have a coherent order.

Respect header hierachy.
